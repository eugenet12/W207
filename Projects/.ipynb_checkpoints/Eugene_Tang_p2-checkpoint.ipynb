    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. Nearest neighbors doesn't work well for this problem because different texts in the same category will still use different words, even if those words are close in meaning. Thus a high \"distance\" can be misleading in this space. (e.g. if one document says \"religion is bad\", and the other says \"I like Christianity\", they will be seen as having no overlap even though they talk about very similar things.). Also, the default KNN uses Euclidean distance, so the length of the document could also influence the perceived \"distances\" (longer documents will be more likely to be \"far\" away from each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Because Naive Bayes tries to estimate probabilities that a word appears in a document of a given category, it likely requires less data to provide a decent estimate. On the other hand, in this case logistic regression may do worse because it does not have examples of each word associated with each category to make a good coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c. From the output above, we can see that the sum of the squared weights generally increase with C. This makes sense because a lower value of C penalizes higher weights more. (C is the inverse of regularization strength)."

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
